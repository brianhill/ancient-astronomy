Star Charts and Globes
======================

Pardies Celestial Cube
----------------------

Probably the most artistic star charts I have ever seen were done in 1693 by Ignace-Gaston Pardies. The star charts are in a &ldquo;gnomonic projection,&rdquo; six of which make a celestial cube. If you print the celestial cube out on 11&rdquo;x17&rdquo; paper and add seven tabs using [these directions](./PardiesCelestialCubeDirections.pdf), you can make a nice model of the heavens to keep around.

Lots more ways to look at the Pardies star charts is on [David Rumsey's website](https://www.davidrumsey.com/blog/2012/8/21/mapping-the-heavens-in-1693).

A kit for making a globe on Giuseppe Civitarese's [Paperpino website](https://www.paperpino.net/celestial-globe-from-ignace-gaston-pardies-tables/) is an involved project for someone with an artistic bent. It takes many, many hours even after the necessary materials are gathered. The result can be quite lovely. I had trouble getting the celestial equator to neatly meet, so I hid my troubles with a narrow ribbon.

Cassini Gores
-------------

Walker requested the Cassini gores I showed. I also got them from [David Rumsey's website](https://www.davidrumsey.com/blog/2009/9/7/cassini-terrestrial-and-celestial-globes-1790)
