Star Charts and Globes
======================

Pardies
-------

Probably the most artistic star charts I have ever seen were done in 1693 by Ignace-Gaston Pardies. The star charts were done in a &ldquo;gnomonic projection,&rdquo; six of which make a celestial cube. If you print the [Pardies Celestial Cube from David Rumsey](./PardiesCelestialCubeFromDavidRumsey.jpg) out on 11&rdquo;x17&rdquo; paper and add seven tabs using [these directions](./PardiesCelestialCubeDirections.pdf), you get a nice model of the heavens to keep around.
