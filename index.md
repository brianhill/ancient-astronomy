## Overview

It is somewhat arbitrary where one might stop in the ancient history of astronomy and astrophysics and deem what follows to be “modern.” For purposes of this course, “ancient” means anything and everything up to but not including or beyond Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo. The shift that occurred very roughly at 1600, although actually it was progressive, not sudden, was to the Sun-centered model of what we now call the Solar System. We will be confining our survey to the science prior to this shift. I could not possibly create such a survey myself; my understanding of astronomy and astrophysics starts when the Earth-centered view was abandoned. So I will be learning the ancient history along with you.
