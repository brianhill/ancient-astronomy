### Mac

#### Donrag

I am going to give Mac a hard time here. Usually I try to be balanced, and certainly there are good things about Mac! He is cheerful, has consistent attendance, consistently turns in homework and scores well on it, and some of his in-class presentations have been quite good.

However, I am going to be short and sweet and go straight to the negative:

He is screwing around a lot. This takes the form of side conversations and other silliness (like making eyes, and even engaging in some slapstick) almost entirely with Clara.

I am so surprised by this behavior, I haven't known what to say when it happens. I have an "are you kidding, do I really have to ask, this is college?" thought when it occurs. I have been hoping it would somehow be self-correcting, and also I have been saving the feedback up for this donrag.

This silliness showed up on the midterm, where Mac only scored 78% of the points, despite some extra credit points possible, and despite it being a pretty straightforward exam.

So, I just want Mac to straighten up and fly right, and I am sure all will be good in Term 3, because he is certainly smart enough and capable of leaving the silliness behind.
