### Clara

#### Donrag

Clara is, as always, smart and incisive. She is also inconsistent. There is a tug-of-war going on between these two things which can go either way.

When I had her for Numerical Analysis on a Pocket calculator the smart-incisive side won out.

When I had her for Cosmology and Black Holes (oops!), the inconsistent side won out, and she ended up dropping the course after getting behind. Coasting on your smartness can get you into trouble.

Ancient Astronomy is sufficiently easy that she is doing very well despite inconsistency. She missed three classes at the beginning of Term 2 and one at the end. Desipite that she got 87% on the midterm which is high-B range.

I have to give here a pretty hard time about something:

There are a lot of silly side conversations going on, especially between her and Mac. This is distracting and disruptive.

I am so surprised by this behavior, I haven't known what to say when it happens. I have an "are you kidding, do I really have to ask, this is college?" thought when it occurs. I have been hoping it would somehow be self-correcting. Since it hasn't self-corrected, I need to bring it up fairly forcefully here. I don't want to intervene in the classroom but I will if I have to
