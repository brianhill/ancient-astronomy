### Rania

#### Donrag

Excellent, diligent student with a strong interest in Ancient Astronomy.

We do a lot of in-class presentations in astronomy. Rania prepares thoroughly for them. In fact, she might be the most thorough of anyone in the class.

Her attendance and assignment turn-in is perfect. She studied hard for the midterm and aced it.

I only have one criticism or concern, which I have made to her a few times, and that is that she seems very tired. This affects concentration and retention. That means she has to study longer and harder and that might be creating a vicious circle. It is also serious enough that it affects physical coordination, and you have to be pretty sleep-deprived for it to affect physical coordination.

I have mentioned this to Tim Gipson so that he knows what is going on and doesn't assign dangerous farm tasks which require full alertness.

So I would say that getting to the bottom of the sleep deprivation is the #1 thing for Rania to do this fall.
