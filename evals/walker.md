### Walker

#### Donrag

Walker is a sleeping giant in Ancient Astronomy. He doesn't insert himself a lot. When he does it is thoughtful and gentle, both in manner and in content.

He doesn't write lengthy problem set solutions. In fact, he shows very little work and tersely states answers. Given this reticence both in class and on homework I was pleased and surprised when he got the stop score on the midterm. I would like to see him put more detail into the problem set solutions.

Clearly Walker is mastering everything we are doing and it is often too easy for him, which explains the reticence. So the question for me and for all of us as we go through mid-semester evaluations of the course direction is how do we make the course better for him and for everybody, without losing the people for whom the course is already challenging enough.
