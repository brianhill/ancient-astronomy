* Thursday, Oct. 26 &mdash; We did course evals &mdash; I was scribe and I will write up what was on the board &mdash; I presented Evans Exercise 5.6 on [Solar Eccentricity](./resources/SolarEccentricity.pdf) &mdash; We got Hipparchus's results for *e* and *A* to within 1 in the last decimal place &mdash; Walker presented Part 1 of Evans Exercise 5.8 and we found the mistake he had been searching for, and was valuable for everybody

### Main Circle Sundial (goes with Equation of Time reading)

* Take a look at the high-quality sundial that is between the Main Building and the Duplex
* The sundial has a strange blob of metal shaped like a figure 8 that accounts for the &ldquo;Equation of Time&rdquo;
* The Equation of time is the drift of high noon throughout the year
* If you know how to use it, the Main Circle Sundial can be read to within a couple of minutes, despite the high noon drift
