### Week 8 &mdash; Continue Solar Theory

* Preparation for Thursday, Oct. 26 &mdash; Read Evans Sections 5.5 to 5.8, pp. 221-235 &mdash; As Assignment 8 for Thursday, do Parts 2, 3, and 4 of Evans Exercise 5.8, p. 235 using your birthday in 2023 for the last part
* Thursday, Oct. 26 &mdash; We did course evals &mdash; I was scribe and I will write up what was on the board &mdash; I presented Evans Exercise 5.6 on [Solar Eccentricity](./resources/SolarEccentricity.pdf) &mdash; We got Hipparchus's results for *e* and *A* to within 1 in the last decimal place &mdash; Walker presented Part 1 of Evans Exercise 5.8 and we found the mistake he had been searching for, and was valuable for everybody

### Week 9 &mdash; Finish Solar Theory &mdash;  Start the Fixed Stars

* Preparation for Monday, Oct. 30 &mdash; Assignment 9 is the completed [Venus](./assignments/venus_plotting/VenusPlottingChart.pdf) and [Jupiter](./assignments/jupiter_plotting/JupiterPlottingChart.pdf) plotting projects &mdash; Finish reading Chapter 5 &mdash; For Monday's presentations we decided that everyone will do all of Evans Exercise 5.10 and in class we will share the presentation of parts of it
* Monday, Oct. 30 &mdash; We discussed the magnitude system (which is coming up in Chapter 6) &mdash; We cross-checked Pollux and Procyon star phases with Rania's values &mdash; We did Parts 1-5 of Exercise 5.10 &mdash; At the end of class, we quickly looked at how the Main Circle sundial corrects for Daylight Savings Time, our longitude being 2&deg; west of the standard Pacific Time meridian of 120&deg;, and the Equation of Time
* Preparation for Thursday, Nov. 2 &mdash; Study Evans 6.1 to 6.4 &mdash; Add the Pollux-vs-Procyon Star Phase diagrams to your Assignment 7 and turn it back in &mdash; ALSO, check your values for your star phases against mine before you hand Assignment 7 back in, and flag any that disagree with me by more than a week
* Thursday, Nov. 2 &mdash; Precession &mdash; Cause of precession &mdash; [Law of Sines](./resources/LawOfSines.pdf) and [Law of Cosines](./resources/LawOfCosines.pdf) &mdash; Parallax &mdash; The apparent vs. true position of the Moon &mdash; We did Ex. 6.5 in class and got 204&deg; as the longitude of Spica

### Week 10 &mdash; Finish the Fixed Stars &mdash; Observing at the College Observatory &mdash; Start Babylonian Planetary Theory

* Monday, Nov. 6 &mdash; Meet at 5am &mdash; We'll observe Jupiter, Venus, and the Moon with a 10&rdquo; telescope
* Wednesday, Nov. 8 &mdash; Meet at 7:45pm &mdash; *Bring a headlamp, there will be no moonlight* &mdash; We'll be observing Saturn, and the Andromeda Galaxy, and maybe we will get a sharper view of Jupiter
* Preparation for Thursday, Nov. 9 &mdash; Read Evans 6.6 through 7.6, p. 312 &mdash; You can just skim 6.9 and 6.10 because the motion called &ldquo;trepidation&rdquo; was just a giant misunderstanding
* Thursday, Nov. 9 &mdash; We augmented our Venus plots by computing the ecliptic longitude of Venus on Oct. 16 &mdash; We reviewed the terminology that Evans introduces with planetary theory &mdash;  I handed out an improved version of the Spica calculations we did in class on Nov. 2 &mdash; Finally, we did Exercise 7.5 (Jupiter's tropical and synodic period) together in class

### Week 11 &mdash; Finish Babylonian Planetary Theory &mdash; Start Greek Epicyclic Theory

* Preparation for Monday, Nov. 13 &mdash; Read Evans through Babylonian System A, p. 328 &mdash; As Assignment 10, do Evans Ex. 7.8 p. 316
* Monday, Nov. 13 &mdash; We used a high-quality gyroscope to gain some intuition about precession &mdash; Mac and Brian presented and gave out handouts on Exercise 5.10, Part 6, the calculation of the Equation of Time &mdash; We looked at Babylonian System A
* Preparation for Thursday, Nov. 16 &mdash; Read Evans through 7.13, p. 347 &mdash; We will do the Babylonian System A' part of Evans Ex. 7.11, p. 334 together in class, so you don't need to prepare for it

### Week 12 &mdash; Ptolemy's Epicyclic Theory &mdash; Construction of Ptolemaic Slats

* Preparation for Monday, Nov. 20 &mdash; Evans through 7.18, p. 362 &mdash; As Assignment 11, do Evans Exercise 7.16, p. 351, the Ptolemaic Slats Project, Parts 1-5 only &mdash; The Ptolemaic slats project requires some arts-and-crafts type work, starting with printing the [Ptolemaic slats onto 11x17](./assignments/ptolemaic_slats/PtolemaicSlatsFor11x17.pdf) paper at 100% &mdash; Finally, we'll start Ex. 7.18 together in class, like we did with Ex. 7.11


### Week 13 &mdash; Ptolemy's Epicyclic Theory  &mdash; Ptolemy's Cosmology &mdash; Cosmology through The Middle Ages

* Preparation for Monday, Nov. 27 &mdash; Evans 7.19 to 7.22 &mdash; As Assignment 12, Finish Evans Ex. 7.18, Parts 1-4 only (we started this together in class, and my solution is already on the corridor wall) &mdash; Finally, we'll do Ex. 7.20, Parts 1-5 only, together in class, so you don't have to prepare it, and we won't do Evans Ex. 7.22

#### *__Personally, I have had my fill of these detailed Ptolemaic calculations and am dying to get to Kepler. Therefore, I propose we skip all the way to 7.25 for Thursday. What do y'all think? Also, jumping some is necessary if we want a taste of modern astronomy (Evans Section 7.31 on Kepler) as our last, triumphant reading on Thursday, Dec. 14.__*

* Preparation for Thursday, Nov. 30 &mdash; Evans 7.25 and 7.26

### Week 14 &mdash; Planetary Equatoria &mdash; Copernicus

* Preparation for Monday, Dec. 4 &mdash; Evans 7.27 to 7.29 &mdash; Your last assignment, Assignment 13, I propose to be Ex. 7.27 (a big gluing, scissoring, and threading project!)
* Preparation for Thursday, Dec. 7 &mdash; Read and come prepared to discuss Evans 7.30
* Thursday, Dec. 7 &mdash; Discuss Copernicus &mdash; Review for Final

### Week 15 &mdash; Final &mdash; Kepler

* Monday, Dec. 11 &mdash; [Final](./exams/Term2Exam.pdf)
* Preparation for Thursday, Dec. 14 &mdash; Evans 7.31
* Thursday, Dec. 14 &mdash; Discuss Kepler
