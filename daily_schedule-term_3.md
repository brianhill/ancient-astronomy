### Week 8 &mdash; Continue Solar Theory

* Preparation for Thursday, Oct. 26 &mdash; Read Evans Sections 5.5 to 5.8, pp. 221-235 &mdash; As Assignment 8 for Thursday, do Evans Exercise 5.8, p. 235 using your birthday for part 4 of the problem
* Thursday, Oct. 26 &mdash; We did course evals &mdash; I was scribe and I will write up what was on the board &mdash; I presented Evans Exercise 5.6 on [Solar Eccentricity](./resources/SolarEccentricity.pdf) &mdash; We got Hipparchus's results for *e* and *A* to within 1 in the last decimal place &mdash; Walker presented Part 1 of Evans Exercise 5.8 and we found the mistake he had been searching for, and was valuable for everybody

### Assignments 8 and 9

* Assignment 8: Due to confusion and general overload this week, the due date is extended to Saturday dinner &mdash; Since Walker presented Part 1, Assignment 8 is now just Parts 2, 3, and 4 of Evans Exercise 5.8 &mdash; For Part 4, use your birthday in 2023
* Assignment 9: Your completed [Venus plotting project](./assignments/venus_plotting/VenusPlottingChart.pdf) using my 10 pre-dawn observations from Sept. 29 to Oct. 23 is due Monday

### Week 9 &mdash; Finish Solar Theory &mdash; Start the Fixed Stars

* Preparation for Monday, Oct. 30 &mdash; We will compare notes on the prior 30 days of [Jupiter plotting](./assignments/jupiter_plotting/JupiterPlottingChart.pdf) &mdash; We could also turn Jupiter in without doing any more observations *OR* we could continue the Jupiter plotting project for two more weeks and turn them in Monday Nov. 13 &mdash; Finish reading Chapter 5 &mdash; For Monday's presentation we decided that everyone will do all of Evans Exercise 5.10 and in class we will share the presentation of parts of it &mdash; Walker suggested that we fill in the other 12 of the 15 stars in the Star phases project

### Main Circle Sundial (goes with Equation of Time reading)

* Take a look at the high-quality sundial that is between the Main Building and the Duplex
* The sundial has a strange blob of metal shaped like a figure 8 that accounts for the &ldquo;Equation of Time&rdquo;
* The Equation of time is the drift of high noon throughout the year
* If you know how to use it, the Main Circle Sundial can be read to within a couple of minutes, despite the high noon drift
