## Star Phases Kit

Back to [Daily Schedule-Term 2](../../daily_schedule-term_2.html)

This is a little kit for making star phases charts for the 15 brightest stars. The kit has three components.

### Component 1: Star Phases Spreadsheet

I have previously handed out a [15-brightest stars spreadsheet](../../resources/15BrightestStars-September.pdf), but [this version of the spreadsheet](./StarPhases.pdf) has columns to record star phases (both true and visible, for each of two latitudes). If you would prefer to work digitally, here is [yet another version of the spreadsheet](./StarPhases.numbers) in Apple Numbers format that you can modify to your heart&rsquo;s content.

### Component 2: Blank Visibility Diagrams

You will need six blank copies of the [star phases diagram](./StarPhasesDiagram.png) in Figure 4.12 on p. 195 to do three stars at each of two latitudes. I have made, copied, and distributed enough for your project, but if you mess some up, here are [blanks you can print](./BlankStarPhasesDiagram.jpeg).

### Component 3: A Program that Computes Star Rising and Setting Times

Rania demonstrated the use of the web version of [Stellarium](https://stellarium.org) to get rising and setting times. Stellarium works on all desktop platforms (web/Mac/Windows/Linux) and is free, so it is hard to beat.

There are also lots of low-cost apps that run on smartphones. My go-tos for star-charting iPhone apps are Sky Guide by Fifth Star Labs and SkySafari 7 by Simulation Curriculum.

Of course, if you were an ancient, you would have to sit out all night for most nights of a year to get the data that we can get in an evening while sitting on a sofa. If you were a medieval scholar, you might have access to an astrolabe (the construction of which we skipped over at the end of Chapter 3)

Although I mentioned some smartphone apps that I often use when outdoors, for this project, using a desktop computer is your best bet, and if you use the [web version of Stellarium](https://stellarium-web.org) as Rania did, you don't even have to download and install anything.
