## Star Phases Kit

This is a little kit for making a nice 11&rdquo;x17&rdquo; chart of the Zodiac. The kit has three components.

As Assignment 7, use a program such as Stellarium to create visibility phases charts for the [15 Brightest Stars](./resources/15BrightestStars-September.pdf) visible at our latitude

### Component 1: The 15 Brightest Stars Spreadsheet

I have previously handed out this spreadsheet, but this version is modified to make it easier to complete this assignment.

### Component 2: Blank Visibility Diagrams

You will need six blank copies of the star phases diagram in Figure 4.12 on p. 195

### Component 3: A Program that Computes Star Rising and Setting Times

Stellarium.
