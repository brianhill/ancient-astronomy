Added 41 Arietis to Aries because it bridges Aries and the Plieades (and hence Taurus too)

The prior version of the constellation mapping work is in the Heavenly Mathematics project along with
many other files that were not brought over to this project.

What is unique about the version in this folder is that quite a few stars have been added to flesh
out some of the less well-represented Zodiac constellations.
