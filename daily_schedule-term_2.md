* Preparation for Thursday, Aug. 31 &mdash; Read Preface and Sections 1.1 to 1.3 of Evans &mdash; Choose any topic from the reading to go into more detail on in a presentation to the class &mdash; Come armed with strong opinions on what we should assign for the next class and the first homework

### Week 2 &mdash; Diurnal, Synodic, and Annual Motion

* Preparation for Monday, Sept. 4 &mdash; Continue in Evans to p. 44 &mdash; Turn in as homework and prepare to present the activities described in Evans Sections 1.3 and 1.5 &mdash; Look ahead in Evans to develop an opinion on what we should cover and present (assigning ourselves supplementary reading is possible!) for the next class
* Monday, Sept. 4 &mdash; Gnomon presentations and a sample [Gnomon Report](./assignments/GnomonReport.pdf) &mdash; Closer examination of figures 1.17 to 1.20 using the [Spherical Concepts](https://www.omniterrum.com/product-category/sold/sold-globe-novelties/cw215art88) celestial sphere &mdash; 366.24 revolutions of the stars per year vs. 365.24 days in a year &mdash; Pixzul's [Zodiacal Motion Animation](./resources/ZodiacalMotionAnimation.mp4)
* Preparation for Thursday, Sept. 7 &mdash; Continue in Evans to p. 58 &mdash; Prepare *two* presentations to share (about five minutes for each presentation) relating in any significant way to the material on pp. 39-58 &mdash; As one project, consider doing something with the [Pardies Celestial Cube from David Rumsey](./resources/StarChartsAndGlobes/PardiesCelestialCubeFromDavidRumsey.jpg) that everyone got an 11&ldquo;x17&rdquo; photocopy of &mdash; Here is additional source material for the more artistic among you relating to [Star Charts and Globes](./resources/StarChartsAndGlobes/index.html)
* Thursday, Sept. 7 &mdash; [Presentations on pp. 39-58](./assignments/presentation_notes-2023-09-07.md)

### Week 3

* Preparation for Monday, Sept. 11 &mdash; Continue in Evans to end of Chapter 1, p. 74 &mdash; Turn in as homework the exercise described in Evans Section 1.18, pp. 73-74 (this is a many-part problem, so budget lots of time to complete it) &mdash; Also turn in as homework two drawings showing the diurnal motion of the night sky *&agrave; la* Rania's (*e.g.,* two drawings of a substantial region of the night sky at least two hours apart) &mdash; Can we please add one more 5-minute presentation on any topic of your choice relating to the remainder of Chapter 1? &mdash; Thursday's presentations were great!
* More to consider for upcoming classes: We could do additional constellation or star projects &mdash; As one idea, I am suggesting locating and memorizing the [15 Brightest Stars](./resources/15BrightestStars-September.pdf) visible at our latitude, starting with the 6 that are easiest to enjoy in the evening in September &mdash; As another idea, locating and memorizing the ecliptic constellations shown in Evans Figure 1.35, p. 55 &mdash; A new lunar cycle begins on Thursday Sept. 14, so in the week or so *after* Sept. 14, we can do the observation described in Evans Section 1.11, p. 58 &mdash; Hexi has located a well-regarded translation of *The Almagest* and we could consider reading selections from it in addition to progressing in Evans
